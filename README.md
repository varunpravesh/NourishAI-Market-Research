## Insights

### Customer Satisfaction

#### Age Distribution
![](Images/Age%20Distribtionn.png)

- The histogram shows a high concentration of users between ages 20-35, peaking around 30 years old. This suggests that the primary user base is **young adults.** 
- The number of users declines steadily from 40 onwards, with smaller peaks around 50 and 60 years old. This indicates that **older adults (50+) are less engaged** with the service. 

#### Most Satisfied Customers
![](Images/MostSatisfied.png)
- There is a strong concentration of satisfied users aged between 20-35, with a peak at 30 years old. The trend is similar to the general age distribution, suggesting that **most users who try the service belong to this age group. **
- There is no major increase in satisfaction among older users, meaning meal plans are **not exceptionally popular among seniors. **

#### Correlation Between Subscription Period and Satisfaction Score
![](Images/SubscriptionCorr.png)
- If satisfaction had a direct impact on subscription duration, we would expect higher satisfaction scores to correlate with longer subscriptions. However, here we see that even dissatisfied users (low scores) have similar subscription lengths as highly satisfied users (scores 9-10). This suggests that **external factors (such as commitment to meal plans, convenience, or lack of alternatives) may be influencing how long users stay subscribed. **
- Since lower satisfaction does not necessarily translate into immediate cancellations, the company might have an opportunity to **increase satisfaction while keeping customers engaged**. Identifying **why lower-satisfaction users remain subscribed** could be a key factor in improving retention.
- The lowest satisfaction scores (1-3) show slightly shorter subscription durations, but not significantly different from other scores. This might indicate that **even the most dissatisfied users don't immediately cancel**, which could be due to factors like prepaid subscriptions or trial periods.
- The length of an average subscription is around 6.6 to 7.1 months across all satisfaction scores. 

#### Feedbacks

- The majority of feedback is positive, indicating that most customers are satisfied with the meal plans. Customers highly appreciate **variety, quality, and convenience**. The meal plans are perceived as **well-balanced and fresh**, attracting health-conscious consumers. **Customer service and flexibility** are valued aspects of the subscription. 
- A small fraction of customers is dissatisfied, likely due to issues such as **delivery delays, portion sizes, or quality inconsistencies.** Some customers desire **more customization options** for meals.
- **Needs, Wish** are among the top keywords which suggest areas where customers expect improvements.
